# Snake Game in Java

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java with a graphical user interface. The player controls the snake using keyboard arrows to collect apples and grow longer while avoiding collisions.

## Features

- Colorful GUI with custom buttons and background
- Sound effects when the snake eats an apple
- Help screen with instructions
- Game over detection and score display
- Object-oriented structure (multiple classes like `Main`, `boardScreen`, `startGameScreen`, etc.)
- Image and audio assets included

## Screenshots

Assets are located in the `images/` folder, including snake head, skin, and apple images.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Eclipse IDE (recommended, project includes `.project` and `.classpath`)
- Audio supported environment (for WAV sound effects)

## How to Run

1. **Import the project into Eclipse:**
   - Open Eclipse
   - Go to `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`
   - Select the `snakeGame` folder
   - Finish the import

2. **Run the game:**
   - Open `Main.java`
   - Right-click and select `Run As > Java Application`

3. **Controls:**

- Adding levels or increasing difficulty over time

- Implementing a high-score leaderboard

- Improving collision detection and movement smoothness

- Making the UI more responsive across different screen sizes

- Refactoring and optimizing code structure

- Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
